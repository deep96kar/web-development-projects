**Web Development Projects**
========================================

Collection of small-to-medium web projects and demos created while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React (Vite).

Purpose
-------
- Quick demos and UI clones to practice layout, responsiveness and JavaScript interactivity.
- Self-contained projects you can open, run and modify to learn specific techniques.

Short descriptions
------------------
- `Add & remove files from folders/`: contains `organize.js` and `restore.js` for organizing file types into folders and restoring them. Useful for automation and file management practice.
- `Amazon clone/`, `Netflix Clone/`, `Mobile clone/`: static UI prototypes demonstrating layout, responsive design and asset usage.
- `clock/`: small JS widget demonstrating time functions and DOM updates.
- `Currency Converter/`: client-side currency conversion demo using `country.js` and basic event handling.
- `Spotipy clone...`: simple music player UI using `songs.json` and sample audio files.
- `Password Manager/`, `Todo list with React/`: modern React apps scaffolded with Vite. They include `package.json`, `src/` and development commands.

How to run
----------
- Static demos: open the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser.
- Node/Vite projects (React apps): run the commands below inside the project folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Tips
----
- If a project needs assets (images, audio), make sure the `public/` or assets folder is present in the project directory.
- For any `package.json` project, open the folder in a terminal and run the install/dev commands above.

Contributions & next steps
--------------------------
- I can add per-project README files (example: `Amazon clone/README.md`) with run instructions and screenshots.
- I can also generate a single script to start all Vite demos on different ports if you want to preview multiple apps at once.

License & reuse
----------------
- These are learning projects — reuse and modify freely. If you'd like a specific license added (MIT, Apache, etc.), tell me which one.
